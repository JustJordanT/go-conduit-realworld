# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### Go codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/specs/backend-specs/endpoints) spec and API.


### [Demo Link](https://demo.realworld.io/)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Go** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Go** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
